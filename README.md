# I've moved! ðŸ‘‹

All of my source code has now moved to [git.aaronjy.me](https://git.aaronjy.me/aaron) - a Forgejo instance I run and manage on my own servers.

There are a few reasons for this:
- I believe it's important to own and control my own data
- I do not want my private repositories to be used to train LLMs
- In protest of the current (2025) USA administration, I am reducing my usage and reliance on US products and services
